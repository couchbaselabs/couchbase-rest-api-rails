# Rails based REST interface for Couchbase #
This is a simple REST interface for doing CRUD ops with Couchbase (get,set,add,replace,incr,decr). I need to add a few more, but it has a solid set of features. It can also do CAS with storage ops.

** Note there is not authentication of any sort in this (although that's not hard at all to add)

Create an environment that has host and port values for the rails app after it's running

Couchbase Server Settings are in /config/yettings.yml
